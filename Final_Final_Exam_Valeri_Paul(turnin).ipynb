Suppose that, to entice the gullible, a casino tells players that there are lots of ways to win: (1, 6), (2, 5), and so on. A little mathematical analysis reveals that there are not enough ways to win to make the game worthwhile; however, because many people’s eyes glaze over at the first mention of mathematics, your challenge is to write a program that demonstrates the futility of playing the game. Your program should take as input the amount of money that the player wants to put into the pot, and play the game until the pot is empty. At that point, the program should print the number of rolls it took to break the player, as well as maximum amount of money in the pot."
